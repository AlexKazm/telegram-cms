            </figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Last year I built Top Medium Stories — a website that showcases the
            Medium’s top stories of all time. This is the tale of how a lone developer scraped thousands of stories and
            hitting seemingly fatal roadblocks.</p>
            <p><em>Spoiler alert: Life finds a way. You can check out the leaderboard — updated daily — at <a
                    href="https://topmediumstories.com/" rel="noopener">TopMediumStories.com</a>.</em></p>
            <h3 id="why-did-i-make-this">Why did I make this?</h3>
            <p>As a long-time reader on Medium, I’ve always been curious what the most popular stories were. While the
                personalized feed and topic pages surface many great stories, just as many slip through the cracks.</p>
            <p>Driven to unearth the gems buried in Medium’s annals, I set a new goal in early 2017: I was going to find
                the most popular stories of all time on Medium and share them with the rest of the world.</p>
            <p>My goal culminated in me publishing my list of the <a
                    href="https://medium.com/startup-grind/most-recommended-medium-stories-by-year-2db66605d5be"
                    rel="noopener">Top Medium Stories By Year</a>.</p>
            <p>I compiled the stories manually, which was a grueling task. Over the period of a week, I visited every
                top stories page since September 10, 2014 (when the top stories feature debuted). To find even earlier
                stories, I dug through publication archives using the Wayback Machine to fetch ancient copies of Medium
                pages.</p>
            <p>I built a massive spreadsheet of every story I found. It was a ton of mind-numbing work, but I was proud
                of the result.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img
                    src="https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*Ctml_IoHbj0xWy78KyJhuw.png" class="kg-image">
                <figcaption>A small section of the colossal spreadsheet ?</figcaption>
            </figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>But my feeling of pride was short-lived, as the list became quickly
            outdated. I wanted to keep it up-to-date, but doing so manually was impossible.</p>
            <p>Then, something dawned on me. I had already determined the manual steps to collect data the first time.
                There was was no reason why I couldn’t just automate those steps with code. Thus, I decided to turn the
                list into a dynamic website.</p>
            <h3 id="automating-data-collection">Automating data collection</h3>
            <p>To automate the manual steps described above, I wrote a web scraper using Python <a
                    href="https://scrapy.org/" rel="noopener">Scrapy</a>.</p>
            <p>The scraper crawls through every top stories page since September 10, 2014 and tosses any story it sees
                into a Python dictionary. The dictionary is then sorted by the number of claps each story received and
                written to a JSON file. (Claps are Medium’s equivalent of a “like” or an “upvote” and readers can give a
                story up to 50 claps.)</p>
            <p>Here’s a snippet of the JSON file:</p><!--kg-card-begin: code-->
            <pre><code>[  “We fired our top talent. Best decision we ever made.”,   {    “recommends”: 79000.0,     “pub_url”: “https://medium.freecodecamp.org",     “author”: “Jonathan Sol\u00f3rzano-Hamilton”,     “image”: “https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*4hU3Xn7wunA81I3v17JIrg.jpeg",     “year”: “2017”,     “story_url”: “https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-fired-our-top-talent-best-decision-we-ever-made-4c0a99728fde",     “pub”: “freeCodeCamp”,     “author_url”: “https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@peachpie"  }],...</code></pre>
            <!--kg-card-end: code--><p>Before building the scraper, I checked Medium’s <a
                href="https://medium.com/robots.txt" rel="noopener">robots.txt</a> file to verify that I wasn’t
            violating any policies. I also set the scraping speed very slow (2 seconds between each request), so the
            scraper wouldn’t hammer Medium’s servers.</p><h4 id="converting-the-data-to-html">Converting the data to
            HTML</h4>
            <p>The next step was transforming the JSON file into HTML to display the stories on a web page.</p>
            <p>I installed <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" rel="noopener">BeautifulSoup</a> to
                do this. First, I constructed an HTML template with empty tables and rows. Then, I wrote a script that
                uses BeautifulSoup to populate the template from the JSON file.</p>
            <p>With a basic HTML file containing all the stories I want to display, it was time to create the actual
                website.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img
                    src="https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*3XTqVVycq5riBcjR3h5ZgA.jpeg" class="kg-image">
            </figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h3 id="building-a-kickass-website">Building a kickass website</h3>
            <p>When planning the website, I had three goals in mind:</p><h4 id="1-minimal-and-elegant-design">1. Minimal
            and elegant design</h4>
            <p>The design language is centered around plenty of whitespace and high-contrast text. This way, the focal
                point is on the stories its trying to highlight, not on the aesthetics of the website itself.</p>
            <p>I also added a “Compact” view mode, which hides feature images from the website. This allows readers to
                skim through the list with ease.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img
                    src="https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*EqIyKAmHT-FrzN4qm7b9mQ.png" class="kg-image">
                <figcaption>“Compact” mode</figcaption>
            </figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h4 id="2-fast">2. Fast</h4>
            <p>The first version of the website was quite sluggish. This is because it was trying to load hundreds of
                feature images at once.</p>
            <p>To solve this issue, I used “lazy loading.” When you land on the website, only the first 50 stories under
                “All” are loaded. If you want to see more stories, you have to click on “Load more.” This design pattern
                drastically reduces the initial loading time.</p>
            <p>Also, to make navigation feel more responsive, I designed this website as a single-page web app. When you
                click on a button, you don’t navigate to another HTML page. Instead, jQuery switches the view
                instantaneously.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img
                    src="https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*nU4Novi6IXdTY7CqBZPzgA.gif" class="kg-image">
                <figcaption>Responsive navigation and lazy loading in action</figcaption>
            </figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h4 id="3-lightweight">3. Lightweight</h4>
            <p>To keep the website light, I chose to forgo most popular frontend libraries. I didn’t use Bootstrap, and
                I kept JavaScript/jQuery usage to a minimum.</p>
            <p>Taking a glance at the project repo reveals a very minimal setup. A few HTML files, a CSS file, a couple
                scripts, and a handful of data files.</p>
            <p>As a result, the website doesn’t have many moving parts and dependencies. It’s very simple to maintain
                and debug.</p>
            <h3 id="testing-and-launching"><strong>Testing and launching</strong></h3>
            <p>I shared the prototype with a couple of friends and asked them to rip it apart. Using their feedback, I
                iterated on the design twice. Then, I launched on Product Hunt.</p>
            <p>I could barely sleep that night. I still remember constantly refreshing the page checking for new
                comments until I passed out from exhaustion.</p>
            <p>The next morning, I scrambled out of bed and clawed open my computer. I couldn’t believe my eyes! Top
                Medium Stories was at the top of Product Hunt’s homepage. At the end of the day, it was awarded the #2
                product of the day.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->

            </figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h3 id="the-sudden-death-of-medium-top-stories">The sudden death of Medium
            Top Stories</h3>
            <p>The Product Hunt launch exceeded my wildest expectations, and I was on cloud nine for a long time. But I
                knew I wasn’t done until I shared my project on Medium. I started this post half a year ago and I
                finally finished it a few weeks ago. I was beyond excited to publish it.</p>
            <p>Before submitting, I decided to run the data collection script one more time to update the website.</p>
            <p>The script failed catastrophically.</p>
            <p>“No big deal. Either Medium has an outage or my internet isn’t working,” I thought. But I was so wrong.
                When I realized what actually happened, I slumped into my chair and dragged my fingers down my face in
                frustration.</p>
            <p>I kid you not, two days prior Medium had removed the top stories page from their website. They scuttled
                the very page my scraper depended on to function!</p>
            <p>I emailed Medium promptly, asking them to consider reverting the top stories page. I didn’t get the
                response I was looking for.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img
                    src="https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*h6hNC0_A-gXqzce1xzDliA.png" class="kg-image">
            </figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>But I didn’t blame them. My website wasn’t officially supported — they
            weren’t obligated to do anything. Even if they didn’t make this particular change, eventually one of their
            updates would break my website. It was inevitable.</p>
            <p>I felt hopeless. Since the website couldn’t be updated anymore, it was no more than a static list that
                was soon to be obsolete. In my mind, Top Medium Stories was dead on arrival.</p>
            <h3 id="the-sprouts-of-new-life">The sprouts of new life</h3>
            <p>For a while, I worked on other stuff and didn’t look at Top Medium Stories at all. But I couldn’t stop
                thinking about the unfinished story of the website. I wanted to publish a postmortem — even if it didn’t
                have a happy ending. It felt like a good way close out the project.</p>
            <p>I closed the article with:</p>
            <blockquote>“So, I hope you enjoyed reading about Top Medium Stories. It was an amazing experience and I’m
                proud of what I made — I’m sorry it had to end this way. There will always be things you can’t predict
                or control, and they can wipe away your work in a heartbeat. That’s life.”
            </blockquote>
            <p>As I stared at my finished draft, I realized something. <strong>I hate sad endings.</strong></p>
            <p>Suddenly, my eyes locked on that same JSON blob I mentioned earlier.</p><!--kg-card-begin: code-->
            <pre><code>[  “We fired our top talent. Best decision we ever made.”,   {    “recommends”: 79000.0,     “pub_url”: “https://medium.freecodecamp.org",     “author”: “Jonathan Sol\u00f3rzano-Hamilton”,     “image”: “https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*4hU3Xn7wunA81I3v17JIrg.jpeg",     “year”: “2017”,     “story_url”: “https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-fired-our-top-talent-best-decision-we-ever-made-4c0a99728fde",     “pub”: “freeCodeCamp”,     “author_url”: “https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@peachpie"  }],...</code></pre>
            <!--kg-card-end: code--><p>And I had a revelation. I didn’t need the top stories page to update the website.
            Instead, I could visit each url in the JSON file and pull the data directly from the story’s webpage.</p>
            <p>To fetch new stories, I could scrape the new Popular on Medium page, which would give me the top stories
                published recently.</p>
            <p>Having refactored my code, I realized something: it is possible that not every single popular new story
                will end up being showcased on the Popular on Medium page. So if you happen to read a story that you
                think should be on Top Medium Stories but isn’t, please let me know. Just send the story’s url to
                <strong>michaeldeng18@gmail.com</strong>, and I’ll add it in right away. Together, we can ensure the
                leaderboards are as comprehensive as possible.</p>
            <p>There is always the risk that Medium might one day restrict scraping completely, or even release their
                own ranking of stories. Either of these changes could make Top Medium Stories obsolete.</p>
            <p>But in the meantime, I will continue maintaining Top Medium Stories, the best website for discovering
                awesome stories.</p>
            <p>If by this point you still have not seen Top Medium Stories, <a href="https://topmediumstories.com/"
                                                                               rel="noopener">go check it out</a>! It’d
                make me very happy if the site helps you find extraordinary stories that you would’ve otherwise never
                stumbled upon.</p>
